# Bulletproof Code (BPC) Translation Examples

Welcome to the Bulletproof Code (BPC) translation example repository. This repository provides sample translation projects for the TRACTOR proposal team to review. Each top-level directory represents an individual example project, containing both the original C code and the translated Rust code generated by BPC. The best place to start is [simple_pointer](simple_pointer) and [simple_math](simple_math).



## Repository Structure

As seen below, each project directory is organized as follows:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d509c1c-9296-4453-ba93-de171981f156)

- **c/**:  
  This directory contains the original C code for the translation if the original project is not an established Git repository. The URL is listed in the notes.MD for each project if it is an established Git repository.  

- **rust.tgz**:  
  This tarball contains the Rust code that BPC generated from the original C code.

- **execution.png**:  
  A screenshot showing the translation metrics for the project. Note that these metrics are preliminary and require further improvement and expansion (see example).

- **`<project>-artifacts.zip`**:  
  Contains the translation artifacts from the first-pass translation. This bundle does **not** include refactoring artifacts. The two relevant items in this are:

  - **MANIFEST**:  
    Lists all the source/translation IR "rules" used during the translation process. Each rule includes references to the corresponding training data, which can be found in the `data` directory within this bundle.

  - **data/**:  
    Directory containing training data used to derive the translation rules.

### Refactoring Artifacts

Currently, the refactoring artifacts are tracked in the Git log within the translated Rust directory. For a detailed view of these refactoring changes, refer to the Rust project's commit history. The screenshot below demonstrates this more clearly.
